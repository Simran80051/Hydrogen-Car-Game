## 1. Introduction to Hydrogen Car Game

**Hydro Havoc** is an eco-friendly, arcade racing game designed to raise awareness about the potential of hydrogen-powered vehicles in a fun and interactive way. The game takes place in the Edmonton Metropolitan Region, where players take on the role of a hydrogen-powered fleet navigating the city’s roads and highways. The goal is to collect hydrogen fuel cells, avoid obstacles, and help build a hydrogen refueling infrastructure to meet the challenge of getting 5,000 hydrogen vehicles on the road.

## 2. Game Overview

- **Genre:** Arcade Racing
- **Platform:** PC (Requires Python and Pygame)
- **Target Audience:** Beginners, gamers interested in sustainability, and eco-friendly themes.

## 3. Features

- **Dynamic Levels:** Players progress through four unique levels with increasing difficulty.
- **Eco-Friendly Theme:** Encounter hydrogen-powered vehicles and futuristic environments while learning about hydrogen infrastructure.
- **Building Infrastructure:** Players can build and upgrade hydrogen refueling stations along key corridors like Calgary to Edmonton.
- **Power-Ups & Challenges:** Collect hydrogen fuel cells and other resources while avoiding obstacles to continue building the hydrogen vehicle fleet.
- **Progressive Gameplay:** As players unlock new routes, they face escalating challenges, with the ultimate goal of deploying 5,000 hydrogen vehicles across the region.

## 4. How to Play

### Objective:
Reach a score of **5000** by collecting hydrogen fuel cells, building infrastructure, and avoiding obstacles along the way.

### Steps:
1. Launch the game by running `main.py`.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the hydrogen-powered vehicle:
   - **Left Arrow:** Move left
   - **Right Arrow:** Move right
3. Collect hydrogen fuel cells scattered on the map.
4. Avoid obstacles and keep your vehicle fueled by building and upgrading refueling stations.
5. The game progresses through multiple levels, with increasing challenges and more fuel cells to collect.
6. Once you have collected enough fuel cells and built out the infrastructure, you will have deployed 5,000 hydrogen vehicles and completed the challenge!

## 5. Level Details

- **Level 1: Standard Road (Easy)**
  - Wide lanes, fewer obstacles, slower vehicle speeds.
